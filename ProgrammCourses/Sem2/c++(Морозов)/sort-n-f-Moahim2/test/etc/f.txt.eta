 Now I find Ive changed my mind and opened up the doors
AND I DO APPRECIATE YOU BEING ROUND
HELP you know I need someone help
Help me if you can Im feeling down
Help1 I need somebody
I never needed anybodys help in any way
When I was younger so much younger than today
Wont you please please help me
but now these days are gone Im not so self assured
help me get my feet back on the ground
help2 not just anybody
